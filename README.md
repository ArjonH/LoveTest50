### Project
LoveTest50

### Background
LoveTest50 uses the Love Calculator API from https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/love-calculator. In order to use this API, you must set up an account at https://rapidapi.com/auth/sign-up. Once an account has been made, you will have access to your own API key in the textbox labeled X-RapidAPI-Key.

### Getting Started
You should have a directory named project that contains a Python based website that is run using Flask. Before the website can be run, the API key must exported using the following command in your terminal:   $ export API_KEY=value
where value is your API key that was previously set up.

### Running
After the API key has been set up, you can start Flaskâ€™s built-in web server (within project/) with:    $ flask run
Visit the URL outputted by flask to see the distribution code in action.
